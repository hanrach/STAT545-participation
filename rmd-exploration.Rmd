```{r load, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(tibble)
library(gapminder)
library(DT)
``````

## Print out gapminder
```{r}
x <- gapminder
x

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
